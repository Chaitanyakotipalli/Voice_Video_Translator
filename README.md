Getting Started 🚀

Clone the repository and follow the instructions to run the app locally:

git clone <your-repo-link>
cd <your-repo-folder>
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py


This keeps it simple, professional, and focused on what you actually implemented.

If you want, I can also draft a slightly more “eye-catching” version with emojis, badges, and minimal visuals that looks great on GitHub without adding fake features. Do you want me to do that?
